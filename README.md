# DevOps:  
## DevOps;
* Why do we need devops?  
  ***Prevent the "wall team"***  
  ***Cloud deployment reduces costs and make projects scalable***  
  ***Promotes colaberation culture***  
  ***Helps superior product creation in less time***  


*  Monolith vs N-tier vs Microservices:  
  ***Monolith - One single program in one location usefull for small programs***  
  ***N-tier - Front end is seperated from the backend and db completely***  
  ***Microservices - All aspects are seperated from all other aspects***  


* Waterfall vs Agile:  
  ***Waterfall - Simple but non-adaptable if things dont go perfectly you will have serious problems at the end***  
  ***Agile - Iterative and flexible, responds to change and creates more robust products***  


* Four pillars of DevOps:  
  1. ***Ease of Use***  
  2. ***Flexibility***  
  3. ***Robustness***  
  4. ***Cost***
